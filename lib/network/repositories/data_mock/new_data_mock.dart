Last season he averaged 36.7 passes per 90 minutes, but that has risen to 53 at his new club.</p>\n<p>He is making the most of that extra possession to impact matches too.</p>\n<p>No one in the Premier League hs played more passes into the box than Maddison.</p>\n<h6>Most passes into the box</h6>\n<p>Despite being a central attacking midfielder, two of Maddison's most eye-catching pieces of skill have come near the opposition byline.</p>\n<p>He turned&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.premierleague.com/players/49481/Bukayo-Saka/overview\">Bukayo Saka</a>&nbsp;brilliantly to cut the ball back for Son to score in the north London derby, and from a short corner at Luton he wriggled his way past a defender to set up&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.premierleague.com/players/75582/Micky-van-de-Ven/overview\">Micky van de Ven</a>&nbsp;for the winning goal.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Right now, he is the division&rsquo;s most confident attacking midfield player.</p>",
